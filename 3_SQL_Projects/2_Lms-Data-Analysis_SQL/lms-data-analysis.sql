   Description: 
      This SQL file contains a set of optimized queries designed to 
      analyze and extract insights from a Learning Management System (LMS) 
      database. These queries provide detailed reports on various key 
      performance metrics, including session ratings, batch attendance, 
      student performance, and test scores, aimed at supporting data-driven 
      decision-making processes in educational environments.
   
      Key Metrics Analyzed:
      - Student ratings for sessions
      - Attendance statistics and performance at the batch level
      - Average test scores and pass rates
      - Student participation insights

   1. Average Session Rating per Student
   Description: 
      - Calculates the average rating provided by each student for 
        the sessions they attended.
      - Returns session details including the instructorâ€™s ID and 
        session ID, facilitating detailed insights on session quality 
        across different instructors.
================================== */

   2. Retrieve All Records from Main Tables
   Description: 
      - Quick diagnostic queries to review data from the main LMS tables 
        for troubleshooting, data auditing, or quick insights.

   3. Batch Attendance Percentage Calculation
   Description:
      - Calculates the attendance percentage for each session within 
        a batch, showing the rate of participation per student.
      - Helps evaluate batch engagement and session reach.
      - Query optimizations ensure accurate session and attendance tracking.

   4. Session Attendance Percentage
   Description:
      - Computes the attendance percentage for each session by comparing 
        the number of students attending to the total active students 
        enrolled in the session's batch.
      - Provides key insights into overall session engagement.

   5. Average Test Score per Student
   Description:
      - Computes the average test score for each student, providing 
        insights into academic performance across multiple tests.
      - Facilitates the identification of underperforming students and 
        helps prioritize academic interventions.

   6. Students Passing Each Test
   Description:
      - Determines the count of students who passed each test, where 
        passing is defined as scoring greater than 40% of the total marks.
      - Offers insight into test difficulty and overall academic success.
================================== */

   7. Detailed Attendance Percentage per Student
   Description:
      - Calculates each student's attendance percentage relative to 
        the total sessions in their active batch.
      - The subquery 'total_sessions' computes the number of sessions 
        available for each student, ensuring that the attendance rate 
        is based on active participation in the batch.
      - Students mapped to 5 or fewer batches are considered.
      - Provides deep insights into the attendance performance of individual students.

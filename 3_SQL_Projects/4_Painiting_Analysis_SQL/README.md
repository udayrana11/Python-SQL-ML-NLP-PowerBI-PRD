# Art Gallery Analysis – Advanced SQL Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of an art gallery database that includes data on artists, paintings, museums, pricing, and more. The SQL script leverages advanced querying techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and conditional logic to generate insightful reports for curators, analysts, and recruiters.
